## Description

In this project we will learn about the details of the FNet architecture by implementing our own version of it. We follow the description from [this article on the FNet article.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03824)

In addition, for a more careful understanding we look into the details of the code found in the [google-research github](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/f_net/input_pipeline_test.py) and in the [transformers github.](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.42.0/src/transformers/models/fnet/modeling_fnet.py)
